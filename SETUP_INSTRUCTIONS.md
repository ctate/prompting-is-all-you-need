## How to Play Multiplayer

‚úÖ Responsive design maintained

## Troubleshooting

### "Connecting to server..." stuck
- Make sure the server is running with `pnpm dev`
- Check that port 3000 is not in use by another application

### Room not found
- Room codes expire when all players leave
- Room codes are case-sensitive (always uppercase)
- Make sure you're entering the exact 6-character code

### Paddle not responding
- Make sure the game has started (host must click "Start Game")
- Move your mouse within the browser window
- Check browser console for any errors

### Players can't connect
- If testing locally, all players must be on `http://localhost:3000`
- For remote play, the server must be deployed and accessible via public URL
- Check firewall settings if deploying to a server

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production:
1. The custom server (server.js) must be used
2. WebSocket connections require proper proxy configuration
3. Ensure the hosting platform supports WebSockets
4. Environment variables may be needed for production URLs

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- Add scoring system
- Add game timer
- Add sound effects
- Add chat functionality
- Add different difficulty levels
- Add tournament mode
- Add AI opponents for fewer than 4 players
- Add customizable colors/themes
