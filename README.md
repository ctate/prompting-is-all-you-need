## Overview

**Prompting Is All You Need** is a mesmerizing interactive experience that combines classic Pong gameplay with pixel art text rendering. Watch as a ball bounces around the screen, colliding with pixelated text that changes color on impact, while AI-controlled paddles dynamically track the ball's movement. The experience features procedural sound generation using the Web Audio API, creating an immersive audiovisual spectacle.

### Key Highlights

- **Pixel Art Text Rendering** - Custom pixel font system for "PROMPTING IS ALL YOU NEED"
- **Procedural Audio** - Real-time sound generation with Web Audio API
- **AI Paddle Movement** - Intelligent paddle tracking and collision detection
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts seamlessly to any screen size
- **60 FPS Animation** - Smooth canvas-based rendering with requestAnimationFrame
- **Interactive Physics** - Realistic ball physics with wall and paddle collisions

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd prompting-is-all-you-need
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   # or
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the game in action!

## How It Works

The experience is completely **self-playing** - no user interaction required! Here's what happens:

1. **Automatic Start** - The game begins immediately when the page loads
2. **Ball Physics** - A white ball bounces around the screen with realistic physics
3. **AI Paddles** - Four paddles (top, bottom, left, right) intelligently track the ball
4. **Pixel Collision** - When the ball hits pixel text, it changes color and plays a sound
5. **Audio Feedback** - Different sounds for wall bounces, paddle hits, and pixel collisions
6. **Responsive Scaling** - Everything scales perfectly to your screen size
